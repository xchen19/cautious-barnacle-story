John is a famous actor in US and he is also good at cooking.

No one knows that he actually has a dual identity. His public identity is a super star who participated in many famous movies. His movies always have good box office. His consummately performance enchant not only the director but also the audience. However,no one knows that he is also the top chef at a Michelin restaurant. He will go to the restaurant to cook for customers during the free time of filming. He feels very happy when others love his meals.

John wanted to keep this identity a secret because he did not want to ruin the quiet, casual, yet upscale feel of the restaurant.
Besides, the restaurant was popular enough, and John didn't want to "blow up the spot", as it were.
Unfortunately, one day, an entertainment journalist came in for a meal and asked for a tour of the kitchen while John was cooking!

Oh no! His identity has been exposed!
Now that everyone knows that he is also a chef, he gets constant offers to host cooking shows.
John becomes even more of a star now that he appears on shows like Kitchen Nightmares and Masterchef.

Finish.
